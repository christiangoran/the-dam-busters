                  Formation No. 1 arrived over the MÃ¶hne lake and Gibson's aircraft (G George) made the first run, followed by Hopgood (M Mother). 
                  Hopgood's aircraft was hit by flak as it made its low-level run and was caught in the blast of its own bomb, crashing shortly afterwards 
                  when a wing disintegrated.
